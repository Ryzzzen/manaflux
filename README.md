> Support for Spanish has been added ! It's work-in-progress.

## Key Features
- Automatic Runes, Item Sets, and Summoner Spells downloading
- Ability to change positions (roles, e.g MIDDLE, TOP) using the User Interface or the shortcuts
<kbd>Alt+Left Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Alt+Right Arrow</kbd>
- You can hide it automatically in taskbar when you're not in champion select
- Instead of controlling your mouse to setup your runes, Manaflux injects them directly in the client, so you don't have to do anything but pick your champion.
- Optimized network requests!

## Getting Started

#### Windows
 > Download the last .exe file in the releases tab, and execute it. That's all !
 The software will be installed on your computer then launched.

#### Mac OS X and Linux
 > You'll need to clone and build it by yourself: `npm install && electron .` Support is unofficial, but if you find an issue feel free to open a ticket.

#### Will I get banned if I use this ?
> Nope. As stated by Riot Git Gene [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/97s4co/so_i_created_a_program_that_automatically_handles/e4bgdmy), Riot allows my app as long as it doesn't affect directly in-game play. (it doesn't.). If something changes, they'll contact me first to fix the problem or even shutdown the repo if it's really necessary. You won't have any problems.
